    "## Overview of basic resampling strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The following four resampling algorithms are described in Section 3a) in van Leeuven's 2009 review paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point is a prior distribution of model states with pdf $p(\\psi^0)$, from which $N$ model state samples (particles) $\\psi_i^0$, $i = 1,...,N$ are drawn.\n",
    "Run the simulation model on all particles $\\psi_i^n = f(\\psi_i^{n-1})$, or in our case `sim.step(t)`. This is the same as sampling from the $p(\\psi^n | \\psi_i^{n-1})$.\n",
    "At this point we see an observation $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, define a posterior distribution $p(\\psi^n | d)$. **Think a bit here before writing more** - from this we obtain weights $w_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic resampling strategies are as follows:\n",
    "### Probabilistic resampling\n",
    "Use the weights as a discrete distribution and sample directly from this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Residual sampling\n",
    "Here, we first resample particles deterministic based on their weights, so that particle $i$ is resampled `np.floor`$(Nw_i)$ times. Define the left-over weights as $w^*_i = Nw_i \\% 1$, and use $w^*_i$ as a discrete distribution. Draw particles from the descrete distribution defined by $w^*_i$ until the ensemble consists of $N$ particles again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic Universal sampling\n",
    "Let each weight represent a bucket on the line $[0, 1]$ with length $w_i$, and draw a random number $u \\sim U[0, 1/N]$.\n",
    "Put $N$ line pieces starting from $u$ with lengths $1/N$ on the line $[0,1]$. \n",
    "The bucket in which each line piece ends defines the particle that is resampled for each of the $N$ line pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Metropolis-Hastings sampling\n",
    "This sampling scheme is described very algorithmicly in the paper (2009, van Leeuwen) already, section 3a4).\n"
