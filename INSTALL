Dependencies
------------

To compile:
- CMake 2.8
- A native build system compatible with CMake 2.8
- OpenCL 1.1
- Boost 1.48.0.2
- Boost Filesystem
- Boost System
- Boost Thread
- Boost Program Options
- Boost Unit Test Framework

To run the OpenCL code:
- An OpenCL-capable device with the appropriate driver installed

To read and write netCDF-files:
- NetCDF C++ (legacy) development files

Pyton dependencies (Windows)
------------------
- Install NVIDIA CUDA 9.1 
- Install NVIDIA CUDA/GPU drivers
- Install Python 2.7 (install Anaconda 32 bit - very important that it is 32 bit)
- Update Anaconda (conda update --all)
- Install PyOpencl 1.2 for python 2.7 32 bit (install from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyopencl NOT from Anaconda. Important that you choose OpenCL 1.2 NOT 2.1)
- Check that OpenCL works
- Install ffmpeg (conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg)


Fast and easy install (Unix/Linux)
----------------------------------

This is how to build the project in a directory "build" residing in the project 
root directory:

> cd <project root directory>
> mkdir build 
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make

The binaries can now be found in "build/bin".


When "fast and easy" fails, or more configuration is necessary
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Make a build directory.
2. Change directory into the build directory.
3. Run "cmake <project root dir>" for default configuration or 
"ccmake <project root dir>"/"cmake-gui <project root dir>" for interactive 
configuration.
4. For ccmake/cmake-gui choose "Configure" (for cmake-gui choose correct
generator) and "Generate". (If you need to add additional cmake modules, due to
an old cmake installation, copy these to "<project root dir>/cmake/Modules".)
5. Exit ccmake/cmake-gui and run the appropriate build command, e.g., "make"
for "Unix Makefiles".
6. Run "ctest" for testing.
7. Binaries are found in the "bin" directory in the chosen build directory.


Downloading datafiles (netCDF)
------------------------------

If you need the project datafiles, these can be downloaded from gpu-ocean.met.no:

> cd <project root directory>
> wget -m -nH -R "index.html*" gpu-ocean.met.no:9000

The commands above will download all datafiles (~5 GB). It is also possible to
download specific files. Visit http://gpu-ocean.met.no:9000/ to browse available
datafiles.
